## 🏗️ System Architecture

ForgeCart utilizes a specialized

### 🔹 Backend Data Flow

The backend handles requests through a structured pipeline:

```mermaid
graph LR
    Req[Request] --> MW[Middlewares: Auth, CORS, JSON]
    MW --> Routes[Routes: /api/products, /api/auth...]
    Routes --> Ctrl[Controllers: Business Logic]
    Ctrl --> Model[Data Access: firebase-admin]
    Model --> DB[(Firebase Firestore)]
```

### 🔹 Architecture Layers

ForgeCart utilizes a specialized architecture designed for performance and scalability:

```mermaid
graph TD
    User((User)) -->|HTTPS| Frontend[Frontend - HTML5/CSS3]
    Frontend -->|Auth Token| Firebase[Firebase Auth Service]
    Frontend -->|API Requests| Server[Express.js Node Server]
    Server -->|Admin SDK| DB[(Firebase Firestore)]
```

    participant F as Frontend (JS)
    participant A as Firebase Auth
    U->>F: Enter Email/Password
    F->>A: signInWithEmailAndPassword()
    A-->>F: Auth Token & User Object
    F->>F: Update UI (Navbar & Profile)
    F-->>U: Success Redirect to Index
```
